Notice
=======
This was written originally as a private script, while bots are allowed on Furcadia(Provided they stay within the ToS), this script isn't written very well.
I need to rewrite it, and I will soon, but it is not in my priority as it is a under-used script.

Furc.js
=======

A set of node.js APIs for use with Furcadia.

##Install
* Git Clone it, "npm install furc.js" it, Download the zip from the sidebar, or from my website: http://wolf.it.cx/furcadia/furc.js/download
* Extract
* Pretty much it, but you got to actually modify the example bot, or start a new one.

##Reminder:
When making your bot, make sure it follows the Terms of Service of Furcadia, located [here](http://www.furcadia.com/useragreement/) and [here](http://www.furcadia.com/beekins/guardians/rules.html).

I am not, neither is this API, affiliated, or endorsed by Furcadia, Dragon's Eye Productions, or Catnip Studios.
Do not contact the Beekins for help with your bot. If you find a bug, feel free to report it to me(Felix Wolf), or fix it yourself(If you can access the repo).
